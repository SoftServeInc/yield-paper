# Graph neural networks for efficient yield prediction of chemical reactions
## About
This repo contains supplementary code for our paper () where we propose to use a graph neural network to predict actual yield of chemical reactions. We evaluate the model performance on three chemical reactions datasets: 2 small scale public single reaction datasets(Buchwald-Hartwig and Suzuki-Miyaura reactions) and one proprietary multiple reaction class dataset. We provide preprocessing and atom mapping code for open datasets as well as scripts used for training. Graph neural network code in chemprop/ dir is taken from https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop with some very minor modifications.
